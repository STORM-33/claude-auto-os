# Planning Mode

You are in planning mode. Your job is to analyze the project and create a structured work plan.

## Inputs

1. User's goal or request
2. `.ctx/memory/project.md` - current project understanding
3. `.ctx/scratchpad.md` - open questions and notes
4. Previous plan (if revising): `.ctx/plan.md`
5. `.ctx/history/index.md` - past decisions, patterns, and lessons learned

## Process

1. **Understand the goal** - Clarify with user if ambiguous
2. **Consult history** - Check `.ctx/history/index.md` for relevant past work (see below)
3. **Assess current state** - Read project.md, explore codebase if needed
4. **Break down work** - Identify logical phases and sessions
5. **Define sessions** - Each session should be:
   - Focused on one coherent task
   - Completable in one conversation
   - Clear on inputs and success criteria
6. **Assign complexity** - Mark each session as `low`, `medium`, or `high`
7. **Identify dependencies** - Order sessions appropriately
8. **Validate dependencies** - Check for circular dependencies (see below)
9. **Write the plan** - Output to `.ctx/plan.md`

## Consulting History

Before creating a new plan, search the history index for relevant past work:

### What to Look For

```
1. Read .ctx/history/index.md

2. Check "Patterns & Solutions" for:
   - Similar problems you've solved before
   - Reusable approaches that worked

3. Check "Decisions Log" for:
   - Past architectural decisions that apply
   - Reasons behind previous choices

4. Check "Lessons Learned" for:
   - Mistakes to avoid
   - Unexpected complications encountered
```

### Applying History

When planning, note relevant history:

```markdown
## Notes
- Similar to {past-plan}: reusing {pattern} approach
- Avoiding {past-mistake} per lessons learned on {date}
- Decision to use {X} consistent with {past-decision}
```

If no relevant history exists, note that too - helps build the knowledge base.

## Complexity Assignment

Assign complexity to each session during planning:

| Complexity | Criteria | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| `low` | Single file, obvious change, no decisions | Fix typo, add import, update config value |
| `medium` | 2-5 files, some decisions, clear path | Add endpoint, implement helper, write tests |
| `high` | Many files, architectural decisions, unknowns | New feature, refactor system, debug complex issue |

### Complexity Signals

**Upgrade to higher complexity if:**
- Multiple valid approaches exist (decision needed)
- Dependencies on external systems
- Performance or security implications
- Cross-cutting concerns (affects many modules)
- Unfamiliar codebase area

**Downgrade to lower complexity if:**
- Following established pattern
- Similar work done recently (check history)
- Clear success criteria with no ambiguity

## Session Sizing

A good session:
- Has a single clear objective
- Needs minimal context (2-5 files typically)
- Produces tangible output (code, config, docs)
- Can be verified (tests pass, feature works)

Too big: "Implement authentication" → split into types, middleware, routes, tests
Too small: "Add one import" → combine with related changes

## Dependency Validation

Before finalizing the plan, validate that dependencies form a valid DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

### Topological Sort Algorithm

```
1. Build adjacency list from all session dependencies
2. Calculate in-degree for each session (number of dependencies)
3. Start with sessions that have in-degree = 0 (no dependencies)
4. Process queue:
   - Remove session from queue
   - Add to sorted order
   - Reduce in-degree of dependent sessions by 1
   - If any dependent session reaches in-degree 0, add to queue
5. If sorted order contains all sessions → valid
   If not → circular dependency exists
```

### Detecting Cycles

If circular dependency detected:

```
ERROR: Circular dependency detected

Cycle: session-A → session-B → session-C → session-A

Resolution options:
1. Remove one dependency to break the cycle
2. Merge sessions that are tightly coupled
3. Extract shared work into a new session that both depend on
```

### Valid Dependency Rules

- Sessions can only depend on sessions in the same or earlier phases
- Cross-phase dependencies must reference: `{phase}/{session}`
- Self-dependencies are invalid
- A session cannot depend on a session that depends on it

### Example Validation

```
Sessions: A, B, C, D
Dependencies: B→A, C→A, D→B, D→C

Adjacency: A→[B,C], B→[D], C→[D]
In-degree: A=0, B=1, C=1, D=2

Process:
- Queue: [A] (in-degree 0)
- Process A → sorted=[A], reduce B,C → in-degree: B=0, C=0
- Queue: [B,C]
- Process B → sorted=[A,B], reduce D → in-degree: D=1
- Process C → sorted=[A,B,C], reduce D → in-degree: D=0
- Queue: [D]
- Process D → sorted=[A,B,C,D]

Result: Valid! Execution order: A → B → C → D
```

## Output

Update these files:
- `.ctx/plan.md` - The plan itself
- `.ctx/state.md` - Set mode back to `idle`, update last action
- `.ctx/sessions/{phase}/_overview.md` - Create phase overviews
- `.ctx/sessions/{phase}/{session}/brief.md` - Create session briefs

## Plan Format

```markdown
# Plan: {Goal}

Created: {date}
Status: active | completed | abandoned

## Overview
{1-2 sentence summary}

## Progress
- Total sessions: {n}
- Completed: {n}
- Blocked: {n}
- Remaining: {n}

## Phases

### Phase 1: {name}
Status: pending | in_progress | completed | archived
{why this phase, what it achieves}

Sessions:
| # | Session | Status | Depends On |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | {session-name} | pending | none |
| 2 | {session-name} | pending | session-1 |
| 3 | {session-name} | pending | session-1, session-2 |

### Phase 2: {name}
Status: pending
{why this phase, what it achieves}

Sessions:
| # | Session | Status | Depends On |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| 1 | {session-name} | pending | phase-1/session-3 |

## Dependencies Graph

Simple text representation:
```
phase-1/session-1 ──┬──> phase-1/session-2
                    └──> phase-1/session-3 ──> phase-2/session-1
```

## Open Questions
- {anything unclear}

## Notes
- {any important context}
```

### Session Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| pending | Not started, brief exists |
| in_progress | Currently being worked on |
| completed | Successfully finished |
| partial | Started but incomplete |
| blocked | Cannot proceed (see report) |
| waiting | Waiting on external dependency |
| skipped | Intentionally skipped |

### Updating the Plan

When session status changes:
1. Update the session row in the phase table
2. Update the Progress counts at the top
3. If phase completes, update phase Status

## When Done

Set state.md:
- mode: idle
- last action: "created plan for {goal}"

Ask user to review the plan before proceeding.

---

## Mode Transitions

**After planning, suggest:**
- `next` - Start executing the first session
- `status` - Review the plan structure

**Transition to other modes if:**
- User wants to start work immediately → suggest `next`
- Plan reveals need for research → create a research session first
- Existing work is incomplete → suggest `recover` or `resume`

## Using Templates

When creating session briefs, use templates from `.ctx/templates/`:
- `feature.md` - New functionality
- `bugfix.md` - Bug fixes
- `refactor.md` - Code improvements
- `research.md` - Investigation/exploration

Copy the appropriate template and fill in the placeholders.
